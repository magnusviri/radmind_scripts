# radmind_scripts

Years ago I used radmind every day.  Now I hardly ever use it.  But I still use it.  Because I hardly ever use it, I can't find my old scripts.  So I'm uploading them here.  The things I still use is diffdir, which only requires fsdiff and nothing else.

Here's links to some of my old documentation.
